							<B>Intro</B>
								
							<p>
							I did full time undergraduate research on Electroholography at BYU for a proof of concept on a novel method of AR headset displays.

							<b>Summary</b>
							<p> 
								I helped design and build a device that utilized Lithium Niobate chips to create waveguides for light to pass through and then be deflectoed by AO (Acousto-optic) modulators, and EO (Electro-optic modulators).
								This novel design in light manipulation was a successful proof of concept for analog method of creating light displays. Possible applications of this are  <b>future AR headsets</b>.

								<p>
									In order to do research here I was trained in <b>clean room photo-lithography device fabrication, wirebonding, the basics of optics, optical testing and set up, and device testing. </b>
								</p>

								<span class="image right"><img src="images/Testing_Rig.JPG" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									I specifcally built a new testing rig that allowed for us to automate mode detection to make testing newly fabricated devices simpler. Prior to my work here there was a very meticulous process of optical alighnemnt 
									and eyeballing mode detection. I constructed and designed a new rig  that would automate the mode detection to create increase testing speed of new prototypes and allow us to do research more quickly.

									<b>Future Iterations/Improvements</b>
									
								</p>

								<p>
									Future iterations of this project would include a better UI and easier integration for other researchers to use the device without too much training. It would also include a more relaible centering technique.
